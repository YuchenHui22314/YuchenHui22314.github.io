I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Montreal. I am a member of the UdeM NLP Lab [RALI](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=en/accueil). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jian-Yun Nie](https://recherche.umontreal.ca/english/our-researchers/professors-directory/researcher/is/in14445/). My doctoral research focuses on enhancing the generalization capability of neural retrieval models. My broader research interests include (interactive) Information Retrieval, Retrieval Augemented Generation (RAG), Multi-modal Learning, as well as some more general topics in NLP and Deep Learning. I am a percussionist who has performed timpani in orchestral settings. In my spare time, I also enjoy playing the guitar and harmonica.

I will be looking for a industry position in late 2025.
